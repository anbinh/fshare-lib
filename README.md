# fshare-lib
This is a PHP library for manipulating downloads at fshare.vn - the biggest file sharing service in Vietnam. The idea of this project is to create a library for developers to work with downloads at fshare.vn. So that we don't need a desktop to download files from fshare.vn, what we need is any headless computer with PHP support.

Fshare.vn doesn't officially provide any APIs so this tool only relies on parsing HTML. We need to keep this up to date with UI changes there.
